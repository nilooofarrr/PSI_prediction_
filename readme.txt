we seek to understand changes in air quality in Singapore from 2016 to 2019.
The data concerns the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), specifically PM2.5. Four bands are on the PM2.5 concentration scale: 0 to 55 for normal, 56 to 150 for elevated, 151 to 250 for high, and very high for higher readings.
We ask you to predict PSI levels in Singapore with precision.
