Model Performance

Model Fit and Diagnostics
Log Likelihood: This is used to calculate the AIC and BIC. While it's not a standalone metric of model quality, a higher log likelihood typically indicates a better fit.
AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion): These are used for model comparison. Lower values generally indicate a better model. Your AIC and BIC values are high, but this isn't unusual with large datasets. Comparing these values to those of other models can help assess relative performance.
Model Coefficients: All coefficients have been estimated with statistical significance (p-values are very small), suggesting the model terms are meaningful.
2. Model Diagnostics
Ljung-Box Test: Your p-value is 0.78, which is high, suggesting that there's no significant autocorrelation in the residuals. This is a good sign that your model has captured the underlying patterns in the data.
Jarque-Bera Test: This test checks for normality of residuals. The very high p-value indicates non-normality, which might suggest that the residuals are not perfectly normally distributed. However, ARIMA models donâ€™t necessarily require residuals to be normal, but it's often a desirable characteristic.
Heteroskedasticity Test: Your p-value is 0.65, indicating that there's no significant evidence of heteroskedasticity. This is good, as it suggests the variability of residuals is consistent over time.



Steps to Choose ARIMA Parameters
Understand the ARIMA Model Components:

AR(p): Autoregressive part with parameter p.
I(d): Differencing part with parameter d.
MA(q): Moving average part with parameter q.
Determine d (Differencing Order):

Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check if the series is stationary.
If not stationary, apply differencing (d) until stationarity is achieved. Typically, d is either 0 or 1, but sometimes it can be 2.
Determine p (AR Order) using PACF:

Plot the PACF.
Look for the lag where the PACF cuts off or drops sharply. The significant lags up to this cutoff suggest the value of p.
For example, if the PACF plot shows a significant spike at lag 1 and then cuts off, p might be 1.
Determine q (MA Order) using ACF:

Plot the ACF.
Look for the lag where the ACF cuts off or drops sharply. The significant lags up to this cutoff suggest the value of q.
For example, if the ACF plot shows a significant spike at lag 1 and then cuts off, q might be 1.
Interpreting ACF and PACF Plots
PACF Plot:

AR(p) Model: The PACF plot helps determine p. Look for the lag where the PACF cuts off sharply. The number of significant lags up to this cutoff suggests the value of p.
ACF Plot:

MA(q) Model: The ACF plot helps determine q. Look for the lag where the ACF cuts off sharply. The number of significant lags up to this cutoff suggests the value of q.


Summary
Based on the diagnostic tests and the RMSE:

Good Signs: The model shows no significant autocorrelation in residuals and no significant heteroskedasticity. Coefficients are statistically significant.
Areas of Improvement: Residuals are not perfectly normally distributed, and the AIC/BIC values are high, which may suggest room for improvement or comparison with other models.


*Next Steps*:

Compare with Other Models: Test different ARIMA configurations or other models (like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, etc.) to see if they provide a better fit.
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like rolling-window cross-validation to ensure the model performs well out-of-sample.
Model Refinement: Consider adjusting model parameters or incorporating additional features if applicable.
